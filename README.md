# Test-Plan-Example
This is my first test plan that I wrote as a course assignment. This test plan was derived from a Software Requirements Specifications file on the Gol fScore project. Sections to include/remove in the test plan was up to my judgement.

The golf program is a very basic program that is used on Windows OS only through command prompt. The program is given any assortment of up to 3 tags, an input filename, and output file directory. All it does is reads an input golf data file and generate up to 3 output files using the data. It has no internet connection. 

Naturally, my test plan is a lot simpler compared to a standard industry test plan due to the SUT being very simple. However, I still did my best to write a diligent test plan. Some of my efforts include:
- very descriptive yet brief writing
- technical document structure and organization
- neat and descriptive tables
- sound logic and reasoning throughout document
- any reference documents are mentioned

I'm sure there are more areas that my test plan can improve on however I published this because I think it's a good demonstration of my documentation skills and understanding of software testing.
